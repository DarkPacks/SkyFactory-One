#Welcome To Sky Factory One!
Hello and thank you for trying out Sky Factory, a modded Sky Block mod pack! Before you go any further, rest assured that yes you ARE actually supposed to have spawned in the void on top of a tree sitting on a single piece of dirt. Don't panic! The mods in this pack will allow you to get all the resources you need to build yourself an amazing world! Read on for more info about how to play this pack, who put it together, and for a list of goals for you to accomplish!

#How To Use This Book|===================
Use the arrows at the bottom left and bottom right of this book to navigate between pages. In the Challenges section of the book you will notice boxes next to each challenge in the list. Simply check the box to indicate that you have completed that challenge. Careful though, they get harder as you go along! Also, don't forget to craft yourself an Achievement Stand to store this book in!

#Where Do I Start?|===============
Here's a quick early game breakdown: make Crooks to get extra drops from leaves. Make barrels to compost saplings and other organic stuff to make more dirt, and to capture rain water. Infest leaves with silkworms to get string. Make a sieve and sift soft materials to get resources. "Stones" can be crafted into Cobblestone. Make a hammer to hammer cobble, gravel and sand. Once it rains put dust into a barrel full of water to make clay. Cook an unfired crucible in a furnace and place it over top of a heat source such as a torch
(and later, lava or fire). Fill the crucible with cobble and it will melt into lava. Use water and lava to make a cobble generator. Once you have the cobble gen it becomes a lot more like a standard modded Minecraft play, and you can use the challenges later in this book  to give yourself direction. Also when you are waiting for trees to grow, try twerking! No, I'm not kidding. Spamming shift, or running around saplings makes them grow faster

#A Note About Biomes|==============
Barrels fill with water just fine when it snows so there is nothing wrong with spawning in a snow biome such as Taiga. It does not rain in desert so barrels will not fill with water, but that is still a fine place to spawn  because of an alternate way of getting water. Look up the crafting recipe for a water bucket in NEI to see that. Oceans will spawn monsters but will not spawn passive animals, and Mushroom biomes spawn only Mooshrooms and no monsters
Because of that, Ocean and Mooshroom are both viable places to spawn in, it will just add to the challenge and force you to travel if you want to complete all the challenges.| |As a bonus, a viewer managed to spawn in a mushroom biome in a Sky Factory world! Here's the seed if you'd like it

#The Challenges|=============
#You can't ever "beat" the pack, but I've provided a list of challenges designed to help you progress, and give direction to your play. Don't worry if you don't know how to do some of them, have fun with the process of searching for answers. You'll learn at lot and have some fun too!
