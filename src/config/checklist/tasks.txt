#Welcome To Sky Factory One!
#Hello and thank you for trying out Sky Factory, a Sky Block modpack! The mods in this pack will allow you to get all the resources you need to build yourself an amazing world! Read on for more gameplay tips and a list of goals for you to accomplish!

#--== How To Use This Book ==--
#Use the arrows at the bottom left and bottom right of this book to navigate between pages. This book contains a challenge section. You do not have to complete the challenges, they are provided to give you ideas on what to do. Once you complete a challenge, click on the box to check it off. Also, don't forget to craft yourself an Achievement Stand to store this book in!

#--== Where Do I Start? ==--
#Here's a quick early game breakdown: make Crooks to get extra drops from leaves. Make barrels to compost saplings and other organic stuff to make more dirt, and to capture rain water. Infest leaves with silkworms to get string. Make a sieve and sift soft materials to get resources. "Stones" can be crafted into Cobblestone. Make a hammer to hammer cobble, gravel and sand. Once it rains put dust into a barrel full of water to make clay. Cook an unfired crucible in a furnace and place it over top of a heat source such as a torch
#(and later, lava or fire). Fill the crucible with cobble and it will melt into lava. Use water and lava to make a cobble generator. Once you have the cobble gen it becomes a lot more like a standard modded Minecraft play, and you can use the challenges later in this book  to give yourself direction. Also when you are waiting for trees to grow, try twerking! No, I'm not kidding. Spamming shift, or running around saplings makes them grow faster

#A Note About Biomes
#It does not rain in every biome but you can still make water using the Wooden Crucibles (Ex Compressum). Simply fill them with leaves or saplings to produce water. Passive and enemy mobs should spawn in every biome.

#The Challenges
#You can't ever "beat" the pack, but I've provided a list of challenges designed to help you progress, and give direction to your play. Don't worry if you don't know how to do some of them, have fun with the process of searching for answers. You'll learn a lot and have some fun too!
