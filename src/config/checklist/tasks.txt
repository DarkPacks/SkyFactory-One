#§5=§6= §0§nSkyFactory® One§r §6=§5=
#Hello and thank you for trying out SkyFactory, a Sky Block modpack! \n \nThe mods in this pack will allow you to get all the resources you need to build yourself an amazing world! Read on for more gameplay tips and a list of goals for you to accomplish!
===
#§5=§6= §0§nHow To Use This Book§r §6=§5=
#Use the arrows at the bottom left and right of this book to navigate between pages. This book contains a challenge section. You do not have to complete the challenges, they are provided to give you ideas on what to do. \n \nOnce you complete a challenge, click on the box to check it off. Also, don't forget to craft yourself a Task Table to store this book in!
===
#§5=§6= §0§nWhere Do I Start§r §6=§5=
#Here's a quick early game breakdown: make Crooks to get extra drops from leaves. Make barrels to compost saplings and other organic stuff to make more dirt and to capture rain water. Infest leaves with silkworms to get string 
#Make a sieve and sift materials to get resources. "Stones" can be crafted into Cobblestone. Make a hammer to hammer cobble, gravel, and sand. When a Barrel is filled with water insert a Dust Block to make Clay. Cook an Unfired Crucible in a Furnace and place it over top of a heat source such as a torch
#(and later, lava or fire). Fill the crucible with cobble and it will melt into lava. Use Water and Lava to make a cobble generator. Once you obtain the Cobble Generator, the progression continues much like other modpacks. \n \nAlso, when you are waiting for trees to grow, try twerking! No, I'm not kidding. Crouch repeatedly or sprint near Saplings to make them grow faster

#§5=§6= §0§nA Note About Biomes§r §6=§5=
#It does not rain in every biome but you can still make water using the Wooden Crucibles (Ex Compressum). Simply fill them with leaves or saplings to produce water. Passive and enemy mobs should spawn in every biome
